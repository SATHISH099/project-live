Hello new to Go Dev's

 Why Go Dev server?

Go Dev'server is a simple web server written in Go. It is designed to be used as a development server for static web sites. It is not designed to be used as a production server.

The server is designed to be run from the command line. It takes one argument, the directory to serve files from.

Usage: go-devserver [directory]

The server will listen on port 8080 by default. This can be changed by setting the PORT environment variable.

The server will serve files from the directory specified on the command line. If no directory is specified, it will serve files from the current directory.
